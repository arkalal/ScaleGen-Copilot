# ðŸ”¥ ScaleGenAI Copilot

---

ScaleGenAI Copilot allows you to have your own product's AI copilot. It integrates with your underlying APIs and can execute API calls whenever needed. It uses LLMs to determine if the user's request requires calling an API endpoint. Then, it decides which endpoint to call and passes the appropriate payload based on the given API definition.

## How does it work?

- Provide your APIs/actions definition, including your public endpoints and how to call them. Currently, ScaleGenAI Copilot supports Swagger OpenAPI 3.0 for bulk import.
- ScaleGenAI Copilot validates your schema to achieve the best results.
- Finally, you can integrate our user-friendly chat bubble into your SaaS app.
